# Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms_Programming_Assignments
The solutions to the programming assignments for the course **Design and Analysis of Algorithms** (CS218) have been uploaded here.

## Programming Assignment-1
This assignment involves calculating the total area and total length covered by the union of a given set of right-angled trapezium-shaped posters. Each trapezium is defined with its base on the x-axis and two parallel edges along the y-axis, specified by four coordinates (ai, 0), (ci, 0), (ai, bi), (ci, di). The goal is to determine:

- The total area covered by the union of all trapeziums.
- The total length covered on the x-axis.

## Programming Assignment-2
This assignment involves scheduling a set of processes to minimize the peak memory requirement, given dependency constraints represented by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The objective is to find an efficient algorithm that reduces the time complexity from O(n!) to O(2^n√ópoly(n)), leveraging dynamic programming techniques.
